Currently, the hotel information does not have a news update system.
There are a total of 4 positions or groups:
1. Admin
2. Supervisor
3. Maid Supervisor
4. Guest

We have an asset management system designed initially for hotels. Our main function is task management. Below are the basic features of a task:

Tasks can originate from various sources.
A task comprises the following fields:
- Task number (unique field)
- Created by (user)
- Assigned to (user)
- Room
- Start time
- Completion time
- Type (Cleaning, Maid request, Technical request, Amenities request)
- Status (Created, Assigned, In progress, Completed, Canceled)

Each type of task has different rules as follows:
○ Cleaning:
- Can only be created by the Maid Supervisor
- Has a specific status (Canceled by guest)
○ Maid request:
- Can only be created by the Maid Supervisor
- Has a “description” field for free text
○ Technical request:
- Can be created by either guests or the supervisor
- Has specific categories to indicate damage in the room (Electrical, Air conditioning, Plumbing, Internet)

Amenities request:
- Can only be created by the guest
- Has specific fields (Type of amenity, Quantity)

"If you want the system to automatically generate mock data, you can use the make init-data command."

"If you want to reset all the data, you can use the reset-db command.
However, if you want to reset and also generate mock data, use the reset-init-db command."

"News Update: This management system doesn't yet have a feature for news updates. This is merely a simulation of creating a Hotel Management system."
